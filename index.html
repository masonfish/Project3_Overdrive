      Welcome to Overdrive! Collect as many coins as you can without crashing
      into the trucks and oil barrels.

    <h3>
      To play, tilt the wheel to move left and right. Make sure the corners of
      the wheel touch the bottom pads. If playing without the MakeyMakey: Use
      the LEFT and RIGHT arrowkeys to move. Press UP to start. Refresh the page
      to try again.

    <h1>THE PROCESS:</h1>

        <h3>
          When we first started brainstorming, we decided to make a game
          inspired by the 1999 SEGA game "Crazy Taxi." The first step was
          creating the base game, which included making a car drive back and
          forth. We still weren't sure how to implement the MakeyMakey in an
          interesting way.

    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <h3>
          One challenge we were able to eventually figure out was getting the
          coins, trucks, and barrels to spawn and fall at different rates. After
          getting the base of the game working, we just needed to add music and
          sound effects, and then implement the MakeyMakey.

    </div>

    <h2>WHEEL PROTOTYPES</h2>
    <h3>
      We decided to use the MakeyMakey by creating a wheel you could turn to
      steer the car. Turning the wheel would result in the bottom corner to
      touch a foil-covered pad, making the car move left or right. Then, we
      created a button using tinfoil and a carboard lever that would start the
      game.

      <div class="column">
        <img src="proto2.jpg" width="400" height="400" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>
      The first wheel prototype was a rectangular shape made to test the
      functionality of the idea. After figuring out the quirks, we remade the
      wheel to be a semi-circle shape, with better handles and a more functional
      START button. One thing we wanted to implement but didn't have time to was
      a reset button, so instead you have to refresh the page.

        <h3>
          We had some playtesters try out our game, and a big thing we needed to
          work on was making sure the game wasn't too hard. Even with this
          issue, we had a playtester manage to win the utlimate high score of 11
          coins!
